# Gun Violence in America Analysis
Gun violence continues to be a significant public health crisis in the United States, with around 40,000 deaths related to firearms each year, underscoring the pressing need for comprehensive policy solutions to tackle this issue according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

# Objective
There is currently lack of comprehensive and easily accessible data on gun violenece in the United States. The dataset used for this project provides over 260,000 recorded incidents of gun violence along with their specific information. The goal of this dataset is to facilite data analysis and exploration to predict future gun violence trends. The dataset includes all recorded gun violence incidents in the United States from January 2013 to March 2018.

The project's objective was to identify trends and relationships between factors contributing to gun-related incidents. This was achieved by conducting exploratory analysis, linear regression, k-means clusterring along with geospatial and time-series analysis.

Although, correlation heatmap did not reveal a significant correlation, linear regression and cluster analysis highlighted a strong correlation betweem total number of incidents and male participants.
